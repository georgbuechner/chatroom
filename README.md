## What we're using here...

### Conan
Conan is a c++ package-manager. 
Using conan simplifies building the project on a new platform, as dependencies will automatically be installed while building.

### CMake
CMake is used to generalize the compilation process. 
As well as conan it is a step towards making a program run on cross-platform, as platform and compiler independent configuration-files are used.
